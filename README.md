# wallets-builder
Generic **core wallets** builder based ont the data provided by [lepetitbloc/wallets](https://github.com/LePetitBloc/wallets) project.

# Usage
If a `Dockerfile` exists for a given wallet in `./wallets/wallet` directory, the image will be built uppon this file.
If it doesn't it will default the `Dockerfile` in the **parent** wallet directory.
